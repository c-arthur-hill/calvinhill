                    <h3>What is a custom software development company?</h3>
                    <p>A bad custom software development company is a jumble of smooth talking salesman and nerds.</p>
                    <p>A good custom software development company is a small team creating custom software applications to streamline your existing business processes like payroll, sales or operations.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="p-3 mb-3  ">
                    <h3>What does a custom software development company do?</h3>
                    <p>They ask how you currently work. They identify wasteful or inefficient processes. They remove them.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="p-3 mb-3  ">
                    <h3>Which is the largest custom software development company?</h3>
                    <p>Accenture has a market cap of $204.21 billion.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="p-3 mb-3  ">
                    <h3>Which is the best software developer company?</h3>
                    <p>You don't want the most technically sophisticated development company. They'll leave you a mess only they can fix.</p>
                    <p>You want a developer who understands your business and delivers technical solutions that can be handed off to any other developer. They are replaceable.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="p-3 mb-3  ">
                    <h3>Which is the Top No 1 software company in the world?</h3>
                    <p>The real question is how to evaluate a software development company.</p>
                    <p>A team of enterprise managers, designers and developers can blow through million dollar budgets and deliver barely working software.</p>
                    <p>The most impressive developers I've seen do more with less. They're individuals or small teams that punch far above their weight.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="p-3 mb-3  ">
                    <h3>How do I find a custom software development company?</h3>
                    <p>The popular answer is referrals. Ask your friends and colleagues.</p>
                    <p>I think we can do better. I offer a money-back guarantee. If you tell me about your project, I'll specify the tasks I think a developer can complete in their first two weeks. Then I'll complete them. If you're not happy, it costs you nothing.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="p-3 mb-3  ">
                    <h3>What is the average cost of custom software development?</h3>
                    <p>Software is a partnership. The more value created, the more expensive it becomes.</p>
                    <p>Million dollar businesses spend between $20k to $32k per developer per month. This doesn't cover accounting, marketing or hosting overhead.</p>
                    <p>Once a developer has a relationship with your business, they will solve problems faster. There's an onboarding timeline.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="p-3 mb-3  ">
                    <h3>What is the difference between bespoke and custom software?</h3>
                    <p>Nothing. These are the same. KISS.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="p-3 mb-3  ">
                    <h3>What are the disadvantages of custom software?</h3>
                    <p>It takes longer and costs more to develop than off-the-shelf competitors.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="p-3 mb-3  ">
                    <h3>Why is custom software development better?</h3>
                    <p>It's not. You should investigate the alternatives. Custom software is the last resort when you find the existing solutions don't fit your business.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="p-3 mb-3  ">
                    <h3>Why is custom software development so expensive?</h3>
                    <p>Custom software is expensive because it takes intelligent and hardworking people a long time to get right.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="p-3 mb-3  ">
                    <h3>What is the life expectancy of custom software?</h3>
                    <p>6-8 years.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="p-3 mb-3  ">
                    <h3>How long does it take to build custom software?</h3>
                    <p>2 weeks. Then another 2 weeks. Then another 2 weeks.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="p-3 mb-3  ">
                    <h3>Who owns custom software?</h3>
                    <p>This is something the contract should define. Usually the business own the rights to code developed. This doesn't mean much if they don't have any way to get the code from the (disgruntled) developer.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="p-3 mb-3  ">
                    <h3>Why invest  in custom software?</h3>
                    <p>Your competition is.</p>
